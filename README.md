# FlexTV.bundle

Control chromecast devices through Plex.

## Installation:

Either download this file as a zip, and extract the directory FlexTV.bundle to your
Plex plug-in directory.  Once extracted, the folder structure should be `/plug-ins/FlexTV.bundle`.

Or, if you have WebTools installed, enter the following url 
to automatically install the plugin:

https://github.com/d8ahazard/FlexTV.bundle

## Usage:

There are a lot of endpoints in here. It's designed to use the current X-Plex-Token for the PMS server when requests are directed to a subset of the /chromecast or /stats endpoints. Refer to https://github.com/d8ahazard/FlexTV.bundle/blob/master/Contents/Code/__init__.py for all of the current endpoints and headers. There's a lot of stuff. :P
